## Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a powerful text-to-image generative model that transforms natural language prompts into high-quality, photorealistic images. It operates in a latent space using a diffusion process, enabling efficient image synthesis with support for diverse styles, resolutions, and creative control. Developed by Stability AI, it is widely used in research, design, and creative applications due to its open-source accessibility and modular architecture.
