## Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a powerful text-to-image generative model that transforms natural language prompts into high-quality, photorealistic images. It operates in a latent space using a diffusion process, enabling efficient image synthesis with support for diverse styles, resolutions, and creative control. Developed by Stability AI, it is widely used in research, design, and creative applications due to its open-source accessibility and modular architecture.


## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by identifying the 'k' closest data points to a given input based on a distance metric (commonly Euclidean distance), and makes predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or average value (for regression) of those neighbors. KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning method that requires no explicit training phase, making it intuitive and easy to implement.
