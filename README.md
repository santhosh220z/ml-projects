## Stable Diffusion

Stable Diffusion is a powerful text-to-image generative model that transforms natural language prompts into high-quality, photorealistic images. It operates in a latent space using a diffusion process, enabling efficient image synthesis with support for diverse styles, resolutions, and creative control. Developed by Stability AI, it is widely used in research, design, and creative applications due to its open-source accessibility and modular architecture.


## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by identifying the 'k' closest data points to a given input based on a distance metric (commonly Euclidean distance), and makes predictions based on the majority class (for classification) or average value (for regression) of those neighbors. KNN is a non-parametric, instance-based learning method that requires no explicit training phase, making it intuitive and easy to implement.


## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models designed to process and analyze visual data. They use convolutional layers to automatically extract spatial features from images, followed by pooling and fully connected layers for classification or regression tasks. CNNs are widely used in computer vision applications such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation due to their ability to learn hierarchical patterns and reduce computational complexity.


## K-Means Clustering

K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition data into distinct clusters based on similarity. It works by initializing 'k' centroids, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid, and iteratively updating the centroids to minimize intra-cluster variance. K-Means is widely used for data segmentation, pattern discovery, and exploratory analysis due to its simplicity, scalability, and effectiveness in uncovering hidden structures in unlabeled datasets.


## Large Language Model (LLM)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced deep learning systems trained on massive text datasets to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They use transformer architectures to capture complex patterns in text, enabling tasks like text generation, summarization, translation, question answering, and code completion. LLMs power modern AI applications such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and intelligent search engines, offering scalable solutions across domains.


## ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree (Brief Overview)

A **Decision Tree** is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It splits data into branches based on feature values, forming a tree of decisions.

- Built using metrics like Gini, Entropy, or Information Gain
- Easy to interpret and visualize
- Supports both numerical and categorical data

## ðŸŒ² Random Forest (Brief Overview)

**Random Forest** is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their outputs to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

- Combines predictions from many trees (usually via majority vote or averaging)
- Handles both classification and regression tasks
- More robust than a single decision tree
- Reduces variance and improves generalization

Useful in high-dimensional datasets and when interpretability is less critical than performance.


## ðŸ“Š Naive Bayes (Brief Overview)

**Naive Bayes** is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem, assuming independence between features.

- Fast and efficient for large datasets
- Performs well with text classification (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis)
- Works best when feature independence roughly holds
- Outputs class probabilities, making it useful for decision-making tasks

Ideal for baseline models and scenarios where interpretability and speed matter.
